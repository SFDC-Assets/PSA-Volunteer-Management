Accelerator Listing: [insert url to the public listing on the Accelerator site](https://gpsaccelerators.developer.salesforce.com/) (tbd once published)

## Description

The Volunteer Management Quick Start Accelerator helps nonprofits stand up a ready-to-use volunteer management solution on Salesforce Nonprofit Cloud. Designed to reduce setup complexity, it delivers a complete foundation for managing both event-based and skill-based volunteer opportunities on the new Volunteer Management (new as of the Summer '25 release).

With this Accelerator, organizations can create, publish, and track volunteer initiatives, job positions, and shifts -- all supported by streamlined Experience Cloud guest access for easy registration. Volunteers can sign up without logging in, while staff can efficiently track attendance, manage locations, and capture valuable engagement data for reporting.
